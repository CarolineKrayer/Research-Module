**Content**

In our student project we investigate the problem of manipulation of the running variable in Regression Discontinuity Design and study a hypothesis test developed by [McCrary](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407607001133?via%3Dihub) in 2008.
In the first part, we formally introduce the framework of Regression Discontinuity Design as well as the impossibility of estimating the treatment effect consistently in the presence of manipulation. We present the idea of McCrary's test, derive the expression for the test statistic and highlight its statistical properties. To complement the theoretical investigation, we perform a simulation study in the second part. Using R, we examine the test's ability to reject the null-hypothesis of no manipulation if manipulation is in fact present as well as the test's asymptotic properties. Finally, we apply the test to a dataset with discrete running variable to study manipulation of social program eligibility in Colombia, an issue investigated by [Camacho and Conover](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.3.2.41) in 2011.


This repository contains our term paper, the presentation held in class as well as the R code used to generate the results in our simulation study and data application.
